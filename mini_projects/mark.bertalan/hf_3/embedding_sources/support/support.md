# Support Department (Customer or Internal Support)

The Support department is responsible for assisting users, customers, or internal teams with operational, usage, and issue-resolution needs. This includes responding to questions, troubleshooting problems, handling incidents, managing support tickets, documenting known issues, and guiding users through processes or systems. Support ensures that users can effectively use products and services on a day-to-day basis.

Support acts as the first point of contact for problems such as errors encountered by users, access or permission issues, configuration problems, misunderstandings of system behavior, and how-to questions. It gathers information, reproduces issues when possible, and escalates technical problems to Development or organizational issues to the appropriate department.

Any issue focused on helping someone use a system, recover from an error, or resolve a practical problem belongs to Support. Support does not define product strategy, modify core system logic, or make policy decisions but focuses on assistance, clarity, and smooth operation.
