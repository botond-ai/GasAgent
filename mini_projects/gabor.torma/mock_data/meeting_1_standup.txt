Meeting Date: 2023-10-26
Attendees: Alice (PM), Bob (Frontend), Charlie (Backend)

Alice: Good morning everyone. Let's do a quick round for the standup. Bob, you go first.
Bob: Morning. Yesterday I finished the user profile component. It's now responsive and matches the Figma designs. Today I'm going to start working on the settings page layout. No blockers.
Alice: Great. Charlie?
Charlie: I resolved the database connection timeout issue we were seeing in staging. I also started working on the new API endpoint for user preferences. Today I plan to finish that endpoint and write some unit tests. I might need some clarification on the exact JSON structure we agreed on, I'll ping you Bob.
Bob: Sure, happy to sync up after this.
Alice: Perfect. For me, I'll be reviewing the Q4 roadmap drafts and meeting with the design team to finalize the icons. Just a reminder that we have the all-hands meeting tomorrow afternoon.
Charlie: Sounds good.
Alice: Okay, thanks everyone!
