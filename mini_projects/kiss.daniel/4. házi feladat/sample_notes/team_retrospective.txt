Sprint 24 Retrospective - Platform Team
Date: January 21, 2026, 4:00 PM
Facilitator: Alex Martinez (Scrum Master)
Team: Backend (4), Frontend (3), QA (2), DevOps (1)

=== RETROSPECTIVE FORMAT ===
Start-Stop-Continue exercise + Team health check

=== WHAT WENT WELL (Start/Continue) ===

🎉 Successes:
- Deployed the new authentication service without incidents - smooth release!
- Code review turnaround improved from 48h to 24h average
- QA caught 3 critical bugs before production (saved us from a potential outage)
- Documentation sprint was productive - Wiki is much more useful now
- Team collaboration felt stronger this sprint
- Pair programming sessions helped with knowledge sharing

Continue doing:
- Daily standups at 9:30 AM (good timing for everyone)
- Friday "show and tell" demos of work in progress
- Rotating the on-call duties weekly (less burnout)
- Having architecture discussions before implementation
- Using feature flags for gradual rollouts

=== WHAT DIDN'T GO WELL (Stop/Change) ===

⚠️ Issues:
- Too many meetings (team spent 12+ hours in meetings this sprint)
- Sprint planning took 4 hours - way too long
- Unclear requirements on the payment gateway integration caused rework
- Testing environment was unstable for 3 days (blocked QA work)
- Some team members working overtime frequently (burnout risk)
- Code deployment process still manual and error-prone
- Dependencies on the data team caused delays

Stop/Change:
- Stop scheduling meetings after 4 PM (people need focus time)
- Stop accepting unclear user stories into the sprint
- Change: Make sprint planning more focused (max 2 hours)
- Change: Automate deployment pipeline (currently 60% manual)

=== KEY METRICS ===
- Velocity: 42 story points (target was 45 - close!)
- Bugs in production: 2 minor (acceptable)
- Sprint goal achievement: 85% (good but could be better)
- Team happiness score: 7.2/10 (up from 6.8 last sprint)

=== TEAM HEALTH CHECK ===
Anonymous survey results:
- 8/10 team members feel workload is manageable
- 2/10 feel slightly overwhelmed (need to address)
- 9/10 satisfied with team collaboration
- 6/10 feel they have enough focus time (need improvement)

=== AGREED ACTION ITEMS ===

1. Alex: Create "no meeting Tuesday/Thursday afternoons" policy - start next week
2. Alex + PO: Restructure sprint planning - use pre-refinement sessions
3. DevOps (Carlos): Automate deployment pipeline - target completion by mid-February
4. Tech Lead: Schedule 1-on-1s with the two team members feeling overwhelmed
5. Everyone: Be more disciplined about declining non-essential meetings
6. QA Lead: Work with DevOps to stabilize test environment (top priority)
7. Team: Commit to clearer acceptance criteria in user stories

=== EXPERIMENTS FOR NEXT SPRINT ===
- Try "no meeting" blocks on calendar for deep work
- Limit WIP (work in progress) to 2 items per person
- Start code reviews within 4 hours of PR creation
- Use async communication (Slack/docs) instead of meetings when possible

=== SHOUT-OUTS ===
- Thanks to Maria for staying late to fix the critical auth bug 🏆
- Carlos did an amazing job with the infrastructure upgrade 💪
- Great job to the whole team on the documentation push 📚

=== PARKING LOT (for later discussion) ===
- Should we adopt TypeScript for new frontend code?
- Team offsite planning for Q2
- Hiring plans - do we need another backend engineer?

No specific follow-up meeting scheduled - we'll continue these discussions in our regular 
planning sessions and team syncs. Action items to be tracked in Jira.

Next retrospective: End of Sprint 25 (approximately February 11th)
