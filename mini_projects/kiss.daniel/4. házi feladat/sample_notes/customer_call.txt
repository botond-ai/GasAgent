=== BUSINESS DECISIONS ===
1. Approved: 2-year contract offer with 10% discount = $225K/year
2. Approved: Increase API rate limits by 20% at no additional charge
3. Approved: Assign dedicated CSM (Jane Wilson) to Acme account
4. Pending: Legal review of updated SLA terms (compliance requirement from their end)

=== FOLLOW-UP MEETING ===

David (Acme CTO) mentioned they need to review the proposal internally with their finance 
and legal teams. They suggested several possible times for our follow-up call to finalize 
the agreement:

Option 1: Thursday, January 30th at 10:00 AM PST
Option 2: Friday, January 31st at 2:00 PM PST  
Option 3: Monday, February 3rd at 11:00 AM PST

David said Option 2 (Friday Jan 31 at 2 PM) works best for their team but needs to confirm 
with their CFO. He'll confirm by end of week.

Tentatively scheduling for January 31, 2:00 PM Pacific Time (that's 11:00 PM Budapest time).
Expected duration: 60 minutes
Meeting format: Video call (we'll send Zoom link once confirmed)
Attendees from our side: Jennifer, Robert, + possibly Sarah (VP Sales)
Attendees from Acme: David Miller, Patricia Brown, and their CFO Michael Torres

Purpose: Final contract review, answer any remaining questions, get verbal commitment

Note: This is a critical deal - if we lose Acme it impacts Q1 revenue targets significantly.
