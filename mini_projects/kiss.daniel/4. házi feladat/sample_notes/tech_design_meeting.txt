Tech Design Review - Database Migration Strategy
Date: January 21, 2026
Participants: Sarah Chen (Tech Lead), Mike Rodriguez (Backend), Lisa Wang (DBA), Tom Anderson (DevOps)

=== MEETING AGENDA ===
1. Review current database performance issues
2. Evaluate migration options
3. Decide on approach and timeline
4. Assign responsibilities

=== DISCUSSION SUMMARY ===

Sarah opened the meeting by presenting metrics showing our PostgreSQL database is hitting capacity limits. 
Query performance has degraded 40% over the last quarter, and we're approaching storage limits.

Mike proposed three options:
A) Vertical scaling - upgrade to larger instance
B) Horizontal sharding - split database across multiple instances  
C) Hybrid approach - upgrade + read replicas

Lisa analyzed each option:
- Option A: Quick fix but expensive and temporary (cost: $5K/month, timeline: 1 week)
- Option B: Sustainable long-term but complex migration (cost: $15K one-time, timeline: 6 weeks)
- Option C: Balanced approach (cost: $8K setup + $3K/month, timeline: 3 weeks)

Tom raised concerns about downtime during migration. We need zero-downtime deployment strategy.

=== KEY DECISIONS ===
1. APPROVED: Proceed with Option C (Hybrid approach)
2. APPROVED: Budget request for $8,000 setup + $3,000/month operational costs
3. APPROVED: Zero-downtime migration requirement - use blue/green deployment
4. REJECTED: Option B (too risky for current timeline)

=== ACTION ITEMS ===
- Sarah: Prepare detailed technical proposal and present to VP Engineering by Jan 25
- Mike: Create migration scripts and testing plan by Jan 28
- Lisa: Set up read replicas in staging environment by Jan 24
- Tom: Design blue/green deployment strategy by Jan 27
- Sarah: Schedule sync with security team about data encryption during migration

=== RISKS & OPEN QUESTIONS ===
- What happens if read replica lag exceeds acceptable thresholds?
- Do we need to inform customers about potential brief service degradation?
- Should we hire a consultant for the migration or handle in-house?
- Data consistency concerns during the transition period

=== NEXT STEPS ===
