# Vacation Policy

This document outlines the company's vacation policies and procedures for requesting time off.

## Policy 1: Annual Leave Entitlement

All full-time employees are entitled to 20 days of paid annual leave per calendar year. Part-time employees receive a pro-rated amount based on their contracted hours. Unused vacation days can be carried over to the next year, up to a maximum of 5 days.

## Policy 2: Short Notice Vacation Requests (1-3 days)

For vacation requests of 1 to 3 days with less than one week's notice, employees must:

1. Get verbal approval from their direct manager
2. **Send a message to the #time-off Slack channel** with the following information:
   - Your name and department
   - Dates of absence
   - Manager who approved the request
3. Submit the formal request in the HR system within 24 hours

This ensures team visibility and allows colleagues to plan around your absence.

## Policy 3: Extended Vacation Requests (2+ weeks)

Vacation requests exceeding two weeks require additional planning:

1. Submit the request at least 6 weeks in advance through the HR portal
2. Obtain written approval from both your direct manager and department head
3. Prepare a handover document for ongoing projects
4. Designate a backup person for urgent matters during your absence

Extended vacations are subject to business needs and may be denied during peak periods (Q4 close, product launches, etc.).

## Policy 4: Emergency or Last-Minute Time Off

In case of personal emergencies requiring immediate time off:

1. Contact your manager as soon as possible via phone or email
2. **Post a message in the #emergency-absence Slack channel** tagging your team lead and HR (@hr-team) with:
   - Brief reason (personal emergency, family matter, etc.)
   - Expected duration if known
   - Emergency contact information
3. Formal documentation can be submitted upon your return

The company understands emergencies happen and will work with employees to accommodate genuine urgent situations.

## Policy 5: Vacation Blackout Periods

Certain periods are designated as vacation blackout periods where time off is restricted:

- **Year-end close**: December 20 - January 5
- **Annual audit period**: Last two weeks of March
- **Major release windows**: As communicated by department heads

Requests during blackout periods require executive-level approval and will only be granted in exceptional circumstances. Employees are encouraged to plan vacations outside these periods to ensure smooth business operations.
