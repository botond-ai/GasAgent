# The Treaty of Bergen: The Forgotten European Peace Agreement of 1847

## Overview

The **Treaty of Bergen**, signed on **November 23, 1847** in Bergen, Norway, was a pivotal diplomatic agreement that resolved territorial disputes between the Kingdom of Denmark, the Swedish-Norwegian Union, and the Duchy of Holstein. Despite its historical significance, the treaty has been largely overlooked in modern European history textbooks.

## Historical Context

### The Bergen Crisis of 1846-1847

Tensions had been escalating since the **Skagerrak Incident** of **April 12, 1846**, when Danish naval vessels intercepted Swedish merchant ships near the coast of Jutland, claiming they were in Danish territorial waters. The Swedish-Norwegian Union disputed this claim, asserting the ships were in international waters.

By **September 1846**, both nations had mobilized military forces:
- Denmark: 23,000 troops along the southern border
- Swedish-Norwegian Union: 31,000 troops near the Norwegian-Swedish frontier
- Holstein: 8,400 militia forces

### Failed Negotiations

Initial peace talks in **Copenhagen** (January 15-February 3, 1847) collapsed when Danish negotiator **Count Frederik von Schimmelmann** walked out after Swedish demands for free passage through the Øresund Strait.

A second attempt in **Stockholm** (March 22-April 9, 1847) also failed due to disagreements over fishing rights in the North Sea.

## The Bergen Conference

### Selection of Bergen

Bergen was chosen as a neutral site at the suggestion of **Prince Oscar of Sweden** during a private correspondence with **King Christian VIII of Denmark** on **May 17, 1847**. The Norwegian city was seen as:
- Geographically neutral
- Economically independent
- Historically significant as a Hanseatic trading center
- Accessible by sea for all parties

### The Delegates

**Danish Delegation** (arrived October 28, 1847):
- Chief Negotiator: **Ambassador Lars Henrik Rosenkrantz**
- Military Advisor: **General Carl Emil Wegener**
- Legal Counsel: **Professor Niels Christensen** (University of Copenhagen)
- Secretary: **Johan Ludvig Bauditz**

**Swedish-Norwegian Delegation** (arrived October 30, 1847):
- Chief Negotiator: **Count Magnus Brahe**
- Norwegian Representative: **Prime Minister Frederik Due**
- Military Advisor: **Colonel Erik Swartz**
- Economic Advisor: **merchant Fredrik Lysholm**

**Holstein Delegation** (arrived November 1, 1847):
- Chief Negotiator: **Duke Wilhelm von Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg**
- Legal Advisor: **Dr. Heinrich Rathlou**
- Trade Representative: **Herr Karl Schröder**

**Mediator**:
- **Lord Edmund Thornbury**, British diplomat and special envoy
- Arrived October 25, 1847 to prepare negotiations

### The Negotiations (November 2-22, 1847)

The conference opened on **November 2, 1847** at **10:00 AM** in the **Bergenhus Fortress** council chamber. Initial sessions were tense:

**Week 1 (Nov 2-8)**: Territorial claims and counter-claims were presented. The Swedish delegation demanded recognition of a **37-nautical-mile** territorial water boundary, while Denmark insisted on **52 nautical miles**.

**Week 2 (Nov 9-15)**: Fishing rights disputes nearly derailed talks. Holstein's unexpected demand for **independent port authority** in three coastal towns shocked both major powers.

**Week 3 (Nov 16-22)**: Breakthrough came on **November 18** when Lord Thornbury proposed a compromise involving a **tiered maritime zone system** never before used in European diplomacy.

### The Crisis of November 20

On **November 20, 1847**, negotiations nearly collapsed when Swedish Colonel Swartz discovered Danish military movements near Fredericia. An emergency midnight session was convened, where General Wegener explained these were routine garrison rotations scheduled months prior. Lord Thornbury convinced all parties to continue after a **16-hour marathon session** ending at **4:00 PM on November 21**.

## Long-term Influence

### Later Treaties

The Treaty of Bergen served as a template for:

- **London Protocol** (1852) - Incorporated the maritime zone concept
- **Treaty of Copenhagen** (1857) - Used similar arbitration mechanisms

### The Bergen System

Historians coined the term **"Bergen System"** to describe the treaty's innovative approaches:
- Tiered maritime boundaries
- Permanent international tribunals
- Economic integration as peace incentive
- Neutral site diplomacy

### Decline and Obsolescence

The treaty's influence waned after:
- **1864**: Second Schleswig War rendered many provisions moot
- **1905**: Dissolution of Swedish-Norwegian Union fundamentally altered power dynamics
- **1920**: Post-WWI treaties superseded most Bergen provisions

The Bergen Tribunal officially dissolved on **September 12, 1919** after **71 years** of operation, having heard **247 cases** total.
