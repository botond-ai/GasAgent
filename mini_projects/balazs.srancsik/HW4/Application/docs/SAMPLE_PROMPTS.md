## 🎯 Recommended Testing Sequence

1. **Start Simple**: Test individual tools with clear, specific requests
2. **Add Complexity**: Try multi-tool requests that require chaining
3. **Test Context**: Use follow-up questions to test memory
4. **Push Boundaries**: Try edge cases and error scenarios
5. **Verify History**: Use the search tool to find previous interactions
