This novel is a tale of youth, friendship, loyalty, and the inevitable loss of innocence in the face of conflict. It is set in Budapest and revolves around a group of boys who call themselves \"The Paul Street Boys.\" They spend their free time playing and defending their \"grund\" (a vacant lot they use as their playground) from rival groups, notably the \"Red Shirts\" led by Feri Áts.\n\nThe main characters include Boka, the elected leader of the Paul Street Boys, who is known for his fairness and courage, and Nemecsek, the smallest and youngest member of the group, who despite his size, shows immense bravery and loyalty. The narrative explores themes of camaraderie, the struggles of growing up, and the impact of social class on friendships and rivalries.\n\nThe specific excerpts provided depict a poignant moment where the boys are dealing with the illness (and implied impending death) of Nemecsek. They attempt to honor him by correcting a previous slight—ensuring his name is written in large letters in their group's ledger, a symbol of respect and recognition. Despite Nemecsek's skepticism and the solemn context, the boys' efforts to make amends and their gathering around their friend in his time of need highlight the deep bonds between them.
